This project provides a comprehensive analysis of retail store data, focusing on sales and profit trends over multiple years and across various regions. Interactive dashboards were created using business intelligence tools, featuring key metrics including total sales, order counts, and profits. The visualizations include yearly sales and profit breakdowns, regional performance (with map and pie charts), and goal-tracking. The project demonstrates data aggregation, visualization best practices, and actionable insight derivation for retail decision-making. Notable features include:

### 1. Year-over-year performance analytics with line and bar charts.

### 2. Regional analysis using maps and pie charts to highlight market diversity.

### 3. Dynamic filters for year and region selection to facilitate deeper exploration.

### 4.KPI displays comparing actual sales to yearly targets.
This repository contains source datasets, dashboard screenshots, and analytic scripts (Excel/Power BI/Python as applicable), enabling others to reproduce or extend the analysis.
